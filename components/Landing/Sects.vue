      ðŸ§  Design Philosophy
    </h1>
    <p><em>Colorful is better than colorless:</em> the colorfulness of something contributes to the distinction amongst the parts of that something, making it marginally easier to understand how things are structured.</p>
    <p><em>There should be balance:</em> not too dull, not too bright. Suitability under various light conditions is a must.</p>
    <p><em>Harmony is superior to dissonance</em>: vivacious colors must complement each other.</p>
